# Authorship Attribution with Document Encodings and Neural Networks

Need to write a decent paragraph of description about the project....

## Getting Started

This will help you get a copy of the project running on your own system.

### Prerequisites

This project was made using a Jupyter notebook. You must have Jupyter installed and running to run this project inside a Jupyter notebook as well. You can find help setting up Jupyter on [its install page](http://jupyter.org/install), as well as the prerequisites for it, most importantly Python. Note Jupyter can run on either versions 2.7 or 3.3+ of Python, but this project was written using Python 3.
Furthermore, it uses Keras running on the TensorFlow framework to construct and run neural networks.

A full list of Python packages used when developing this project can be found at [PACKAGES.md](PACKAGES.md). They should be installed in your Python environment using "pip install (package)".

### Installing

Once the prerequisites are installed, this project should not need any additional setup to run. Simply clone the project into a folder within an instance of Jupyter, and it should be ready to run.


End with a little demo of getting some data out of the network (will link out to DEMO.md in final version).

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
