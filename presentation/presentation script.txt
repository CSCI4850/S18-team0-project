Introduction:
Our project was over Authorship Attribution for Small Documents.

--introduce ourselves and our roles in the group

Authorship Attribution is the process of determining the author of a document by means of analyzing the text.
With the rise in popularity of programs such as Twitter, Facebook, email, and messaging apps, that can instantly
send messages around the world, the size of our documents are shrinking. Since these technologies allow for instant
communication there is no longer a need to have large ammounts of information in our documents. Think of the last
message you sent, I would be suprised if it was more than a sentence. 

For all the good these technologies bring there is a dark side to them as well. Most of the programs offer a 
means of psuedo-privacy which can lead to problems. Some people use this anonymity to engage in cyber bullying,
attempt to influence sales of products through leaving fake positive/negative reviews, or even using someone elses 
account to leave hateful comments. Having the ability to tie a post to the correct person or find all fake reviews 
left by one user, even if they have multiple accounts, is something that is important now and will only grow in 
importance as technology continue to evolves.

Authorship Attribution and Neural Networks go hand in hand as at its core Authorship Attribution is just a 
classification problem. And as we all know by now Neural Networks are quite good at classification problems. 
There has already been research done in using Neural Networks for Authorship Attribution, if you are interested 
in the topic you can read more about it in the paper that inspired this project 
http://cs.uh.edu/~prasha/papers/cnn-aa-short.pdf. The goal of our research was to find a better way to determine
Authorship from short texts.
